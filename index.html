    <p>
        I know this gift might seem a little unusual, but I truly tried my best.

        I started learning web development just to create something that would make you proud .
         You know how shy I am, how hard it is for me to express my feelings. I can’t sing to you the way you sang to me on my birthday, and I’m not good at big gestures like that. 
        I did think about buying you a gift, but I couldn’t decide. 
      <br><br>
      So about a month before your birthday, I started planning this. The idea of making you a website came to me, and I began learning, trying, and doing everything I could—simply as a way to express my love.
      And of course, my love for you has no end.
      <br><br>
      I wanted to thank you in this message, because as you can see from the countdown, even if the time seems short, you changed me. You changed the way I think, helped me grow, and made me see life in a completely different color. I truly became a different person—and I’m not exaggerating at all. 

I’m deeply in love with you.
 I can’t, and I don’t want to, move away from you anymore.
  I’ve grown used to your calls, your voice, and your presence in my life. 
  In short… you became a part of me.



My shyness held me back even while writing this, as you can probably tell.
 I’m not good at expressing myself—but on your birthday, I truly wish you all the happiness and success in the world.
 And I hope that one day, I’ll be right there next to you, celebrating it with you.
 <br><br>
I love you.
<br><br>
Yours,
<br>
Manel
